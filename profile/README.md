ultimaille is an organization that focuses on the development of the ultimaille software library for mesh processing and a set of tools and plugins that enables visualizing and interacting with these meshes.

## Mesh interaction and visualization

To visualize and interact with meshes, we use the Graphite modeler. Most tools are available as plug-ins or add-ons:

 - Plugins must be placed and compiled with the Graphite's source code 
 - Add-ons are external programs - with a particular protocol - that can be run from Graphite.

ultimaille is an organization that focuses on the development of the ultimaille software library for mesh processing and a set of tools and plugins that enables visualizing and interacting with these meshes.

## Around the ultimaille library

 - [ultimaille](https://github.com/ultimaille/ultimaille) - the software library for mesh processing
 - [ultimaille hello](https://github.com/ultimaille/ultimaille-hello) - hello world using ultimaille library
 - [ultimaile examples](https://github.com/ultimaille/ultimaille-examples) - a series of examples to help you understand how to use ultimaille

## Mesh interaction and visualization

To visualize and interact with meshes, we use the Graphite modeler. Most tools are available as plug-ins or add-ons:

 - Plugins must be placed and compiled with the Graphite's source code 
 - Add-ons are external programs - with a particular protocol - that can be run from Graphite.

 - [graphite plugins from texel](https://github.com/ultimaille/graphite-texel-plugins) - A plugin suite for Graphite
 - [graphite add-ons loader](https://github.com/ultimaille/graphite-addon-loader) - A module that enables to load add-ons from Graphite
 - [graphite add-ons examples]([graphite-addon-examples](https://github.com/ultimaille/graphite-addon-examples)) - A suite of add-ons that can be used from Graphite (once add-on loader was installed)
 - [param parser](https://github.com/ultimaille/param-parser) - A library to use when you want to create your own Graphite add-on
